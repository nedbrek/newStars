<h1 align='right'><a name='INTRO'>Introduction</a></h1>

<p>This programmers manual describes Mini-XML version 2.2.1, a
small XML parsing library that you can use to read and write XML
and XML-like data files in your application without requiring
large non-standard libraries. Mini-XML only requires an ANSI C
compatible compiler (GCC works, as do most vendors' ANSI C
compilers) and a "make" program.</p>

<p>Mini-XML provides the following functionality:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Reading of UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded XML files and
	strings.</li>

	<li>Writing of UTF-8 encoded XML files and strings.</li>

	<li>Data is stored in a linked-list tree structure,
	preserving the XML data hierarchy.</li>

	<li>Supports arbitrary element names, attributes, and
	attribute values with no preset limits, just available
	memory.</li>

	<li>Supports integer, real, opaque ("cdata"), and text
	data types in "leaf" nodes.</li>

	<li>Functions for creating and managing trees of
	data.</li>

	<li>"Find" and "walk" functions for easily locating and
	navigating trees of data.</li>

</ul>

<p>Mini-XML doesn't do validation or other types of processing
on the data based upon schema files or other sources of
definition information, nor does it support character entities
other than those required by the XML specification.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Mini-XML was initially developed for the <a
href='http://gimp-print.sf.net/'>Gimp-Print</a> project to
replace the rather large and unwieldy <tt>libxml2</tt> library
with something substantially smaller and easier-to-use. It all
began one morning in June of 2003 when Robert posted the
following sentence to the developer's list:</p>

<blockquote>It's bad enough that we require libxml2, but rolling
our own XML parser is a bit more than we can
handle.</blockquote>

<p>I then replied with:</p>

<blockquote>Given the limited scope of what you use in XML, it
should be trivial to code a mini-XML API in a few hundred lines
of code.</blockquote>

<p>I took my own challenge and coded furiously for two days to
produced the initial public release of Mini-XML, total lines of
code: 696. Robert promptly integrated Mini-XML into Gimp-Print
and removed libxml2.</p>

<p>Thanks to lots of feedback and support from various
developers, Mini-XML has evolved since then to provide a more
complete XML implementation and now stands at a whopping 2,974
lines of code, compared to 103,893 lines of code for libxml2
version 2.6.9. Aside from Gimp-Print, Mini-XML is used for the
following projects/software applications:</p>

<ul>

	<li><a href='http://www.cups.org/'>Common UNIX Printing
	System</a></li>

	<li><a href='http://www.cups.org/ddk/'>CUPS Driver
	Development Kit</a></li>

	<li><a href='http://www.easysw.com/printpro/'>ESP Print
	Pro</a></li>

	<li><a
	href='http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net'>ZynAddSubFX</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Please email me (mxml @ easysw . com) if you would like your
project added or removed from this list, or if you have any
comments/quotes you would like me to publish about your
experiences with Mini-XML.</p>
