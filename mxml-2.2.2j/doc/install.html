<h1 align='right'><a name='INSTALL'>1 - Building, Installing,
and Packaging Mini-XML</a></h1>

<p>This chapter describes how to build, install, and package
Mini-XML on your system.</p>

<h2>Compiling Mini-XML</h2>

<p>Mini-XML comes with an autoconf-based configure script; just
type the following command to get things going:</p>

<pre>
    <kbd>./configure ENTER</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The default install prefix is <var>/usr/local</var>, which
can be overridden using the <kbd>--prefix</kbd> option:</p>

<pre>
    <kbd>./configure --prefix=/foo ENTER</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Other configure options can be found using the
<kbd>--help</kbd> option:</p>

<pre>
    <kbd>./configure --help ENTER</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Once you have configured the software, use the
<tt>make(1)</tt> program to do the build and run the test
program to verify that things are working, as follows:</p>

<pre>
    <kbd>make ENTER</kbd>
</pre>


<h2>Installing Mini-XML</h2>

<p>Use the <tt>make</tt> command with the <kbd>install</kbd>
target to install Mini-XML in the configured directories:</p>

<pre>
    <kbd>make install ENTER</kbd>
</pre>

<p>If you are using Mini-XML under Microsoft Windows with Visual
C++, use the included project files in the <var>vcnet</var>
subdirectory to build the library instead.</p>


<h2>Creating Mini-XML Packages</h2>

<p>Mini-XML includes two files that can be used to create binary
packages. The first file is <var>mxml.spec</var> which is used
by the <tt>rpmbuild(8)</tt> software to create Red Hat Package
Manager ("RPM") packages which are commonly used on Linux. Since
<tt>rpmbuild</tt> wants to compile the software on its own, you
can provide it with the Mini-XML tar file to build the
package:</p>

<pre>
    <kbd>rpmbuild -ta mxml-<i>version</i>.tar.gz ENTER</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The second file is <var>mxml.list</var> which is used by the
<tt>epm(1)</tt> program to create software packages in a variety
of formats. The <tt>epm</tt> program is available from the
following URL:</p>

<pre>
    <a href='http://www.easysw.com/epm/'>http://www.easysw.com/epm/</a>
</pre>

<p>Use the <tt>make</tt> command with the <kbd>epm</kbd> target
to create portable and native packages for your system:</p>

<pre>
    <kbd>make epm ENTER</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The packages are stored in a subdirectory named
<var>dist</var> for your convenience. The portable packages
utilize scripts and tar files to install the software on the
target system; this is especially useful when installing on
systems with different Linux distributions. Use the
<var>mxml.install</var> script to install the software and
<var>mxml.remove</var> script to remove the software.</p>

<p>The native packages will be in the local OS's native format:
RPM for Red Hat Linux, DPKG for Debian Linux, PKG for Solaris,
and so forth. Use the corresponding commands to install the
native packages.</p>
